# cloudfil

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `cloudfil` is to fill the gaps in satellite images caused by clouds.

# Installation

The package can be installed from Github as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github("mmontesinosanmartin/cloudfil")
```

# Example

This is a basic example that shows how to fill the gaps from a satellite image left by clouds. In addition to the cloudy image, the algorithm requires a clear-sky image. This clear-sky image works as a reference.

```{r dataset}
library(cloudfil)
data("clr.img")
data("cld.img")
plotRGB(cld.img, stretch = "lin")
```


```{r fill}
fill.img <- fill_stack(clr.img, cld.img, w = 10)
plotRGB(fill.img, stretch = "lin")
```
